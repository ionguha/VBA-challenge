## Background
I am well on my way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! As a skilled programmer in VBA, I decided to use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data and perform the following challenging tasks. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

### Stock market analyst

* Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Also provided a conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


### CHALLENGES

1. My solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

2. By making appropriate adjustments to my VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
